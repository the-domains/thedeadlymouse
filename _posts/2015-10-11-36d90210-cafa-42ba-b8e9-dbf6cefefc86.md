I signed up for @thegrid back on Oct 9, 2014\. It was said all Founding Members would be in the beta in the Spring of 2015\. Then it was changed to late Spring 2015\.

Of course then by May 2015 it was said they'd miss that date and NOT all Founding Members would get in right away. They decided to do it in waves, problem was it was 100 in June and not one more till in August.

Then came Oct 8, 2015 when they announced they were now letting more people in. They told us that each day they would add more and more people in.

I was happy about that but sad I had to wait even longer. But I figured I would be added by Sunday Oct, 11 2015 or Monday Oct 12\.

Boy was I surprised when on Friday Oct 9, 2015 I got my beta email. So I quickly got things setup for it. It had been one full year since I became a Founding Member and I was HAPPY.

But then it happened, I started quickly noticing problems. Posts were only showing the first sentence, the post draft were disappearing and I can no longer edit on delete them. Even sometime things posted would take a while to even appear on the site.
