The servers will be shut down midnight December 31, 2015.  It is sad, it was a pretty cool little game. It was a Pokemon style game where you fought creatures and captured them so you could use them to capture other creatures.  It was awesome to have a Pokemon style MMORPG for the PC and iOS. But, you better get to playing it while you have the chance. Maybe if enough people show them they like Moonrise and willing to buy things in-game, maybe, just maybe they'll decide to keep it up and running."

They said they just weren't making enough profit to keep the servers up and running. You can continue on playing it for now, they are even offering a Sunset Pack including 2,000 Gems and 10,000 gold. The servers will be shut down midnight December 31, 2015\. It is sad, it was a pretty cool little game.
