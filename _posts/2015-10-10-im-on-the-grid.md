After months and months of wait, I am now finally on @thegrid Beta. So far I am not sure what to think of it.

Yes it is neat but so far it doesn't seem to be as easy to do post as it would be on a site builder such as [Weebly][0] or [Squarespace][1]. I will keep trying it and see what I can make of it.

It is keep right now if you wish to [join][2]. You can easy become a [Founding Member][2] for $96 a year. If you want this deal you better take it before Beta ends. If you miss this offer it will end up costing you around $25 a month.

How ever tho as long as you pay the $96 it will stay that price for you FOREVER unless you cancel.
